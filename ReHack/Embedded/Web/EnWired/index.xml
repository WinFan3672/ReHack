		<Title />
		<Text>EnWired was a quarterly computer magazine that published from 1978 to 2008. Founded by [yellow]Jacob Marksman[/] (1917-2002), the publication was massively influential in the early computer magazine space, and was a cultural icon.</Text>

		<Text>Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Starting in the early 2000s, EnWired suffered from financial trouble due to the fading popularity of printed publications and 'zines in general, which culminated in 2008 with EnWired Publications LLC going bankrupt.</Text>
		<Break style="None"/>
		<Text>In 2005, the rights to the EnWired name, logo mark, and articles were transfered to a new parent company, EnWired Holding Plc., who agreed to buy EnWired Publications for just $1. This was done to protect EnWired's articles in the event that the publication went down.</Text>
