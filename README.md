# ReHack
ReHack is a terminal-based hacking game about an organisation who aren't what they seem.

> [!note]
> This is the **new** version of ReHack written with .NET. For the "legacy" version written in Python, go [here](WinFan3672/ReHackLegacy). 

> [!note]
> The aforementioned "legacy" version is more feature-complete, and work is being done to port over its features. For the time being, the game is in a very early state.


## Running
Either use `dotnet run` or open the project in Visual Studio. It's just a .NET app.
